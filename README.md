 Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project is to recommend movies based on user preferences and past interactions. The system aims to provide personalized movie suggestions to users, enhancing their viewing experience.
 The Movie Recommendation System is designed to suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy. By analyzing user ratings, genres, and movie metadata, the system predicts and recommends movies tailored to individual tastes. The project utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to provide accurate recommendations.
 
FEATURES:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies that are similar to the ones the user has liked.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the content and metadata such as genre, director, and cast.
Hybrid Filtering: Combines collaborative and content-based methods for enhanced accuracy.
Real-Time Recommendations: Provides instant movie suggestions based on the latest user data.
Interactive User Interface: A web-based interface where users can input their ratings and receive recommendations.
 

THE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM EMPLOYS SEVERAL MODELS,INCLUDING

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.
Matrix Factorization: Implements Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
Content-Based Filtering: Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity measures.
Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based methods to enhance recommendation quality.



A project for Detecting Credit Card Fraud using machine learning techniques. The objective is to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the provided dataset.
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset available on Kaggle.

FEATURES:

V1-V28: Result of a PCA transformation.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise.

MODEL:

The project uses a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. The main models explored is:

Logistic Regression
